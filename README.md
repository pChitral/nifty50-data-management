# Brings the data for NIFTY50 stocks
This code gets you the OHLCV Data for NIFTY50 stocks so you giving you a headstart in your technical analysis.  
I presently dump the data from the "n50xlsx" file, which I've downloaded from the NSE's official website 
You get a dictionary with ticker name as the key and OHLCV Data as it's value.

## Boilerplate for anyone who wants to code their own strategies 
Personally, I use this to get data for my Quantitative Analysis project, which is yet to be made public, and have coded several trading strategies using the historic data.
