# OHLCV Data for NIFTY50 stocks 
This presently dumps the data from the "n50xlsx" file which I downloaded from the NSE's official website 
I have created a dictionary with ticker name as the key which holds OHLCV Data as it's value.

## Stores closing price in a dataframe and OHLCV in as a value in dictionary.
I use this to get data for my Quantitative Analysis project, which is yet to be made public.
